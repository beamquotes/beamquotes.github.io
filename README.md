# BEAM quotes

## About

BEAM quotes is a place to put quotes about the BEAM, Erlang, Elixir and concurrency.

Feel free to publish a PR, an issue, or a tweet to me to add a quote to the website!

## How to add quotes

Quotes are stored into the `_data/quotes.yml` file. It's just a regulary YAML file with a list of quotes (content, author, and source). Just add it at the top of the file and done!

## Thanks
